## Getting Started
_ **Note**: You REALLY should be running `nvm` so, go get that. If not, go install NodeJS 7.6.0 or greater. It's not 1974._

`$ npm install`

## You're Done!
You may now run things like `npm start -- createRoles --dry`.
If you haven't worked with npm scripts in the past, you may be thinking: _Holy crap what are all of those `--`, well it's how we pass arguments to the script that `npm start` is executing. That's all.

### You're Curious?
`$ npm start -- --help`
